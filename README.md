This README file contains information about my uploaded assignments. This is my first edit for assignment 1
Fun tip for any of my classmates who did not already know it, but if you want to re-use a command that you used before or forget a command you can click the up arrow on windows (do not know if it works for other systems..).
Down arrow also works to go back to a specific command.
