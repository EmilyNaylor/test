# testThis README file contains information about my uploaded assignments
This README file contains information about my uploaded assignments. This is my first edit for assignment 1
Fun tip for any of my classmates who did not already know it, but if you want to re-use a command that you used before or forget a command you can click the up arrow on windows (do not know if it works for other systems..).
Down arrow also works to go back to a specific command.
Here is my fifth commit! Halfway there.
The command for locating where you are in a system is pwd
This is a test to see if I actually understand what I am doing
Another fun tip, to reduce error when using your filename, use tab!
If your file is in the same directory as you are then it will fill in the rest of your file name up to the point where it doesn't match another filename so name your files somewhat uniquely at the begininng
I.E. you can name your test files 1test, 2test, 3test, etc. And then use tab to fill in the rest!
I just saw that I did an extra commit and am actually on commit 12 now
Ok I think I have a decent understanding of what is happening now
